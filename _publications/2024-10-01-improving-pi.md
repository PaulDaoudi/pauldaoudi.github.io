This paper presents a control strategy for a non- linear throttle valve with an asymmetric hysteresis, leading to a near-optimal controller without requiring a priori knowl- edge about the environment. We start with a carefully tuned Proportional Integrator (PI) and leverage the recent advances in Reinforcement Learning to improve it thanks to additional interactions with the valve. We test the proposed controllers in a variety of scenarios, all highlighting the benefits of combining both frameworks for improving control performance in non- linear stochastic systems. The resulting agent has a better sam- ple efficiency than traditional Reinforcement Learning agents and outperforms the PI controller in all the tested use cases.
