I am a PhD student at [Huawei's Noah's Ark Lab](http://dev3.noahlab.com.hk) in Paris, dedicated to studying new efficient methods to enhance the sample effiency of Deep Reinforcement Learning agents. 

My PhD is in collaboration with [GIPSA-Lab](https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr) from UGA, under the supervision of [Christophe Prieur](https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/~christophe.prieur/index.html), [Bogdan Robu](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/bogdan-robu-541471.kjsp?RH=UAINTERFR_ANN), [Merwan Barlier](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LTA3ETQAAAAJ&hl=fr) and [Ludovic Dos Santos](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=TNPp0cwAAAAJ&hl=fr).


I developed an interest in Machine Learning research during my gap year in my engineering studies at Ecole Centrale de Lille. There, I did two research internships at Airbus [Central Research and Technologies (CRT)](https://www.airbus.com/en/innovation/industry-4-0/artificial-intelligence) and IBM Research in the [Watson Health](https://www.ibm.com/industries/healthcare) team. This led me to continue my studies in statistics at my school and simultaneously pursue a Master in Applied Mathematics at Université de Lille. I also took various classes in the Master MVA (Mathématiques - Vision - Apprentissage) at ENS before starting my PhD at Huawei.


Outside of this, my interests are mainly related to outdoor activities, where I have recently developed an interest in running, hopefully leading to Triathlons next year.
