My focus is to find better ways to introduce external knowledge in this field to enhance the sample efficiency of current Reinforcement Learning agents. This has led me to study Offline Reinforcement Learning, Reinforcement Learning with Guides, Simulation-to-Reality Reinforcement Learning, and I am currently focusing on Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning.
I am looking forward to discover new ways to introduce information in this process !

Real-World Applications
======

Reinforcement Learning agents are typically evaluated in simulated environments. Recently, I experimented my agents on a real-world Throttle Valve system, which proved to be quite interesting. This experience has sparked my curiosity, and I'm eager to delve deeper into studying the specific challenges that Reinforcement Learning agents could encounter in real-world systems.

General Machine Learning
======

During my studies, I had the opportunity to explore various areas within the Machine Learning field. I am not limited to Reinforcement Learning and intend to broaden my knowledge in other fields (Generative Models, Causality, Graphs...).
